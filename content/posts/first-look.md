Aside from causing my mouth to water, leafing through _East_ makes it clear that
there will be a lot recipes in the coming weeks that are well outside my comfort zone.
Now, nothing is outside my comfort zone to eat. I'm talking about recipes that are going
to require skills I probably don't have. Chef Sodha's going to ask me to put an egg inside
a loaf of bread. You might as well be asking me to put the caramel inside the Caramilk bar.
There's an entire dessert section inside every cookbook that I rarely lay eyes on. This time
I won't have that option, and this one's full of fancy (scary?) terms like _tarte tatin_.
Have you ever made dumplings yourself? Yea, me either.
