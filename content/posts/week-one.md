My partner, Ena, started up an instagram account for this blog. "I'm going to look up what
hashtags we should be using, I wonder if _#meerasodha_ is one that people use." She says,
proceeding to check. What a gallery of photos that turned out to be, and what a terrifying
standard to keep. It's full of posts by people who probably make money either cooking or
posting on instagram. This is fine. I thought our dishes were nice, but everyone online has
fancy speckled clay stuff. I'm just going to go find the nicest looking item in our home and 
photograph it for the next post.

### A Note on Noodles (Dish: Green Onion and Ginger Noodles, pg. 90)

Whole wheat noodles. What are these?
I know that in general "whole wheat noodles" can be used to describe the makeup of a noodle,
but I'm talking specifically the noodle variety called _Whole Wheat Noodles_.
There is photographic evidence of their existence in _East_. Chef Sodha claims they are
"widely available". Well I looked, and I either looked poorly or in the wrong places because
I did not locate them. I asked for help at the local Japanese grocer "Hi, I need some help.
I'm looking for whole wheat noodles". I received a puzzled look. "Is that not a thing? Ok,
I want noodles but not udon, ramen, or soba". Another look, and then he figured it out. "Ohh!
Somen. You want somen noodles". I was so happy, and I bought the somen noodles. It turns out
Somen noodles are not whole wheat noodles. It also turns out that _Green Onion and Ginger
Noodles_ is delicious no matter the noodle.

### Dish: Udon Noodles, pg. 88

What a home run. The ball is no longer in the stadium.
If you have _East_ and haven't whipped this one up yet, go do it now. I did not leave any for lunch the next day.
Chef Sodha mentions in her Introduction that these recipes are how she cooks for herself,
her family and her friends. There's something reassuring in that fact. These recipes are --
I don't know the proper word -- simple in a way that isn't basic. They come together in time
for dinner, and I'm not left feeling inferior somehow if things aren't exactly how I imagined.
Like this dish did for me and Ena though, it makes you feel like a star when it turns out. Meera, you
helped make our week.

Ena admitted that she was nervous when first seeing that I would be making this recipe
because she doesn't like cooked cabbage (I knew this and chose it anyway, _shhhhh_. We have
to get through the whole book in the end, right?). I can now claim to have converted her.
She said she like the crispy blakened edges on the roasted cabbage wedges, and that she
didn't know this was achievable. I'll be bragging about that one to her folks.
It's a nice sense of accomplishment to have turned the dread into an enjoyable meal.

I didn't not pickle my own ginger for this, but I will. It's in the book after all.
