My partner started up an instagram account for this blog. "I'm going to look up what
hashtags we should be using, I wonder if _#meerasodha_ is one that people use." She says,
proceeding to check. What a gallery of photos that turned out to be, and what a terrifying
standard to keep. It's full of posts by people who probably make money either cooking or
posting on instagram. This is fine. I thought our dishes were nice, but everyone online has
fancy speckled clay stuff. I'm just going to go find the nicest looking item in our home and 
include it in the next post.

Dish: Udon Noodles, pg. 88
- simple
- I bought way too much cauliflower & cabbage
- nice crispy edges on the cabbage
- Ena thought she didn't like cabbage
- ahhhhh did I get the wrong noodles?
- nice feeling of accomplishment
- found mirin at Sanko
