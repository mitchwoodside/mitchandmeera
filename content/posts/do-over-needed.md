The onigiri is the first dish for which I'm going to ask for a do-over. Sure it's crossed
off in the list, but it still didn't measure up to some arbitrary standard I've held in
my head. They were still enjoyable, and I reached for them for lunch the next day,
but Ena still politely left them for me to consume after trying one. It's a little bit
heartbreaking because they were one of the dishes I was most looking forward to.
The filling turned out great, too.
There was just too much rice between the outside world and the miso filling.
It took too long to reach paydirt.

The onigiri are simple, sure, but they're a little tricky to execute properly. Like
discussing politics at family dinner, the premise is simple, but you need to know a trick
or two to pull it off right. It sounds really easy to wet your hands and cover some filling
with a layer of rice of the desired thickness. It was not. We didn't enjoy these as much
as we could (should?) have. I'm chomping at the bit to get my next chance. I guess there's
nothing stopping me from making them again tonight.

On the bright side, I now know what the heck the onigiri cards in
[Sushi Go](https://gamewright.com/product/Sushi-Go) represent. It won't help we win the
game, but I think I'm a lost cause.
