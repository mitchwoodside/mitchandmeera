I'm a mildly capable home cook with an affinity for the work of [Chef Meera
Sodha](http://meerasodha.com/about/). The ongoing global pandemic has put a halt to most of my usual
hobbies, and so my partner has put me up to a cooking project: cook my way
through Chef Sodha's most recent publication, _East_, in
its entirety.

This idea is not original. I shamelessly stole it from [Julie Powell](https://twitter.com/licjulie?s=20),
who famously cooked her way through Julia Child's _Mastering the Art of 
French Cooking_ in 365 days. She turned her popular blog into a book and
a movie both titled _Julie & Julia_. I've gone for the same first
name-based aliteration here and called this little project _Mitch &
Meera_.

This is a small personal project meant for the fun and the food. Part of
the fun is to write a little bit about it online, so feel free to follow along
here if you like.
